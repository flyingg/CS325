Contributors - Cierra Shawe, Grant Smith, Gerald Gale

Instructions:
- To run the program create a new directory in FLIP on the PuTTY connection to the OSU Server
- Using a FTP uploade both MSS_Problems.txt AND project1_Main.py to the same directory 
+ Make sure MSS_Problems.txt AND project1_Main.py are the ONLY 2 files in the directory to keep things neat 

Run projectMain.py using the command “python project1_Main.py -c}” 
The program will run. There should be a new file called “MSS_Results.txt” in the same directory MSS_Problems.txt AND project1_Main.py are in. That file will have the results that you need

Instructions:
- To run the program create a new directory in FLIP on the PuTTY connection to the OSU Server
- Using a FTP uploade both Coin1.txt AND project2_Main.py to the same directory 
+ Make sure Coin1.txt AND project2_Main.py are the ONLY 2 files in the directory to keep things neat 

Run projectMain.py using the command “python project2_Main.py -exp” 
The program will run. There should be a new file called “Coin1change.txt” in the same directory Coin1.txt AND project1_Main.py are in. That file will have the results that you need
